# Hello World Webpage Project Hello! 

My name is Patrick Gawienczuk and I am student currently studying GitHub and its respective Codespaces and Pages. This repository is my first project, and explores the basics of online programing and version controls.

## Project Description 

To complete this project I created a GitHub repository, utilized GitHub Codespaces for the first time to write HTML code. After exploring HTML and CSS to create the webpage, I published it to begin my journey of web hosting

## Files in the Repository 

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the "Hello World" webpage. It contains the structure and content of the webpage. 
- `README.md`: This file, providing details about the project and the learning process. 

## View the Webpage You can view the webpage I created at `https://piotrusg.github.io/helloworld/`.

## Questions or Issues 
If you have any questions about my project or encounter any issues, please open an issue in this repository, and I'll look into it as soon as possible.
